# Inversion count of an array

Given an array, find the number of inversions of it.

If (i < j) and (A[i] > A[j]) then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of an array A. We need to count all such pairs in the array.
 
For example,

Input:  A[] = [1, 9, 6, 4, 5]
Output: Inversion count is 5

There are 5 inversions in the array – (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)
